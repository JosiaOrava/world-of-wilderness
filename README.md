# world-of-wilderness
This was final project in first year done by me, Johanna Toivanen and Valtteri Niininen.
<br> It uses 5 API:s which are: <br>
* eBird (Birds) <br>
* iNaturalist (Whales and mammals)<br>
* Wikipedia (Info about species)<br>
* Leaflet (Map)<br>
* MapOfLife (Pictures about animals)<br>

## How to use
When you open the page you are presented with empty map. You can then click on the icons on top of the map for searching different animals.
* Whale -> Whales and dolphins
* Bird -> You select a country and after that it shows the bird sightings in that country
* Mice -> Shows different mammals around the world
<br>
After that it starts to load markers on map and when you click marker it shows picture of the animal and on the rightside panel it shows its name, coordinates of the sighting and little info about the animal. <br>

#### Other icons
* Person icon -> shows our team and little trailer video we created for the website.
* Home icon -> resets the map
